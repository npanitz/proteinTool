# proteinTool
A tool that allows users to enter protein names and store pages for proteins and fetches descriptions of those proteins. The users can then edit the description and other attributes
which will update the respective attributes in the Mongo Database so all users can have updated databases of the collective proteins. Essentially functions as a wiki for proteins.
